# mastodon-link-ripper

Mastodon Link Ripper downloads the timelines from the Mastodon instances you specify, grabs all the article links it finds, filters out duplicates, and displays them to you in aggregate. Think ersatz Nuzzel without the popularity features. 

Everything is contained in one HTML file, so you should be able to download it and open it locally in your browser. I have tested it in Ubuntu/Chrome but not for anything mobile -- I don't have an easy way to test mobile design.
